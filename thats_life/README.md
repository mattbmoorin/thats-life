<h3> That's life </h3>

> That's life is a bare bones message board application where you are only allowed to see random messages. You can create a new message, but you can only edit it if it 'comes back' to you. Like throwing a bottled message into the ocean, that's life.

<h1> How it works </h1>

> You sign up, and begin creating and viewing messages. Share your deepest thoughts, or insults.

> Select New Post to create a new post. 

> Select That's Life to see a random post.

> You may edit your post if it happens to appear for  you.
