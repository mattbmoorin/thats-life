<h1> That's life </h1>

> That's life is a bare bones message board application where you are only allowed to see random messages. You can create a new message, but you can only edit it if it 'comes back' to you. Like throwing a bottled message into the ocean, that's life.

<h3> How it works </h3>

> You sign up, and begin creating and viewing messages. Share your deepest thoughts, or insults.

> Select New Post to create a new post.

> Select That's Life to see a random post.

> You may edit your post if it happens to appear for you.

<h3>todo</h3>

<b> Change edit view to Post route so the post id does not display in the URL.
